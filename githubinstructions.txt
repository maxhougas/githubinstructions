Sign up for github. This should be fairly self-explanatory and no different than signing up for most other web services.

Navigate to your settings. This should be under the dropdown menu in the upper right that is your avatar.

On the left hand menu all the way at the bottom is an item called "Developer settings". Click it.

Once again on the bottom of the left hand menu is an option called "Personal access tokens". Click it.

In the upper right, click "Generate new token".

Write some kind of descriptive note like "Amazing super powers".

Set the expiration to "No expiration".

Check all checkboxes.

***
***DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THROUGH!***

Click "Generate token" at the bottom.

You will be shown your personal access token. DO NOT SHOW THIS TO ANYONE.

Upon leaving or refreshing this page you will not be shown this token again; keep it somewhere safe.

***YOU MAY NOW CONTINUE***

Using the avatar dropdown menu on the upper right select "Your repositories".

Click "New" in the upper right.

Name your repository "test" and give it a description. Optionally check the box to add a README file.

Click "Create repository" at the bottom.

If you chose to create a README file, you will be shown a list of files in your new repository (so far just README.md)

Click the green code button to be presented with an HTTPS url.

If you chose not to create a README file the HTTPS url will be near the top of the page.

Open your bash shell.

Navigate to the folder you would like to clone your repository to.

Run "git clone <url>"

*If you have problems with your url try removing .git from the end.

Cloning your repository will create a new folder called "test" (or whatever you named your repository).

Run "cd test/.git"

Use your favorite text editor to open "config".

Look for a line that starts with "url =". It sould be under the heading [remote "origin"]

Between "https://" and "github" insert the pattern <username>:<personal access token>@

Save changes and close your editor.

Run "cd ..".

Run "echo helloworld > hw.txt".

Run git config --global user.email "<your email>"

Run git config --global user.name "<your name>"

Run "git add .".

Run 'git commit -m "I'm adding a file!"'.

Run "git push".

Refresh your browser window to verify that hw.txt was successfully pushed.
