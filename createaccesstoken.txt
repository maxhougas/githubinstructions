Sign up for github. This should be fairly self-explanatory and no different than signing up for most other web services.

Navigate to your settings. This should be under the dropdown menu in the upper right that is your avatar.

On the left hand menu all the way at the bottom is an item called "Developer settings". Click it.

Once again on the bottom of the left hand menu is an option called "Personal access tokens". Click it.

In the upper right, click "Generate new token".

Write some kind of descriptive note like "Amazing super powers".

Set the expiration to "No expiration".

Check all checkboxes.

***DO NOT CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THROUGH!***

Click "Generate token" at the bottom.

You will be shown your personal access token. DO NOT SHOW THIS TO ANYONE.

Upon leaving or refreshing this page you will not be shown this token again; keep it somewhere safe.

***YOU MAY NOW CONTINUE***
