This lesson assumes you have successfully completed lesson 00. Check the section of ./00basicgit.txt labeled ***YOU SHOULD HAVE*** before continuing.

Navigate to your local test repository (C:\gitprojects\test) and open your gitbash shell from the right click menu.

Ensure that your local repository is synced with your remote by running
 Run "git pull".
  If this fails run "git pull --rebase" or "git pull --merge". For our purposes there should be no difference.
  You can also run "git config pull.rebase <true or false>" and run "git pull" again.

Run "git checkout -b <branch name>" using "test" for the branch name.
 This will create and switch to a branch named "test".

Open ./helloworld.htm in your favorite editor.

Update line 7 of ./helloworld.htm by changing "  <title>Document</title> to "  <title>Hello World</title>".

Save the file.

Verify the changes work by opening ./helloworld in your favorite browser.
 You should see "Hello World" displayed on the active tab.
